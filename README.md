# README.md## Frameworks and Languages Used- Spring Boot- Jakarta Persistence (JPA)- Lombok- MySQL## Data Flow### 1. Controller- **AddressController:** This controller handles endpoints related to addresses.  - `POST /address`: Add an address.- **OrderController:** This controller manages order-related endpoints.  - `POST /order`: Add an order.  - `GET /orders/id/{id}`: Get order details by ID.- **ProductController:** This controller is responsible for product-related operations.  - `POST /product`: Add a product.  - `GET /products`: Get all products.  - `GET /product/category/{category}`: Get products by category.  - `DELETE /product/id/{id}`: Delete a product by ID.- **UserController:** This controller handles user-related endpoints.  - `POST /user`: Add a user.  - `GET /user/id/{id}`: Get user details by ID.### 2. Services- **AddressService:** Service class for managing addresses.  - `addAddress(Address address)`: Add an address.- **OrderService:** Service class for managing orders.  - `addOrder(Order order)`: Add an order.  - `getAllOrders(Integer id)`: Get all orders by user ID.- **ProductService:** Service class for managing products.  - `addProduct(Product product)`: Add a product.  - `getAllProducts()`: Get all products.  - `getProductByCategory(String category)`: Get products by category.  - `removeProductById(Integer id)`: Remove a product by ID.- **UserService:** Service class for managing users.  - `addUser(User user)`: Add a user.  - `getUserById(Integer id)`: Get user by ID.### 3. Repository- **AddressRepo:** JPA repository for the Address entity.- **OrderRepo:** JPA repository for the Order entity.- **ProductRepo:** JPA repository for the Product entity.- **UserRepo:** JPA repository for the User entity.### 4. Database Design- The project uses a SQL database with four entities: Address, Order, Product, and User.- Relationships:  - Address has a many-to-one relationship with User.  - Order has many-to-one relationships with User, Product, and Address.## Data Structures Used- Entity classes (Address, Order, Product, User) representing database tables.- JPA repositories for data access.## Project SummaryThis project is a Spring Boot application that manages multiple entities in a SQL database. It includes controllers, services, and repositories for Address, Order, Product, and User entities, allowing you to perform operations like adding, retrieving, and deleting data. The project follows a RESTful API design, making it suitable for building web applications or APIs that require managing users, addresses, orders, and products.You can use the provided endpoints to interact with the database and manage the data related to these entities efficiently.
